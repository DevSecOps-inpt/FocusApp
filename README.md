# FocusLock

A production-ready Android app for app blocking, focus mode, and digital wellbeing. Stay focused by blocking distracting apps and implementing scheduled focus sessions.

## Features

- üîí **App Blocking**: Block access to distracting apps with PIN/biometric unlock
- ‚è∞ **Focus Mode**: Quick and scheduled focus sessions with app whitelisting
- üåê **Internet Blocking**: Optional VPN-based internet blocking during focus sessions
- üìä **Usage History**: Track blocked attempts and focus session analytics
- üîê **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally with encryption, no network access
- üé® **Material Design 3**: Modern, beautiful UI following Google's design guidelines

## Privacy & Security

- **Offline-Only**: No internet permissions, all data stays on your device
- **Encrypted Storage**: SQLCipher database encryption with Android Keystore
- **Secure Authentication**: PIN and biometric authentication options
- **No Tracking**: Zero analytics, telemetry, or user tracking

## Requirements

- **Android API 26+** (Android 8.0 Oreo and above)
- **Required Permissions**:
  - Usage Access (for app detection)
  - Display Over Other Apps (for lock overlays)
  - Accessibility Service (fallback detection)
  - Battery Optimization Exemption (for reliability)

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Navigation Compose  
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture (presentation, domain, data)
- **Async**: Coroutines + Flow
- **DI**: Hilt
- **Database**: Room + SQLCipher (encrypted)
- **Background**: WorkManager + AlarmManager + ForegroundService
- **Authentication**: BiometricPrompt + Android Keystore

### Core Components
- **App Detection**: UsageStatsManager (primary) + AccessibilityService (fallback)
- **Lock Overlay**: System overlay Activity with authentication
- **Focus Enforcement**: Foreground service with persistent notification
- **VPN Service**: Optional per-app internet blocking
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted using Android Keystore

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1 or newer
- JDK 17 or newer
- Android SDK with API 34

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/focuslock.git
   cd focuslock
   ```

2. Open in Android Studio and sync project

3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

### Debug vs Release
- **Debug builds** use unencrypted database for easier testing
- **Release builds** use SQLCipher encryption for production security

## Development Status

This project contains the complete foundational architecture:

‚úÖ **Completed**
- Project structure and build configuration
- Room database with encrypted storage (entities, DAOs, converters)
- Hilt dependency injection setup
- Security manager with Android Keystore integration
- Material Design 3 theming and resources
- Android manifest with all required permissions

üöß **In Progress**
- Data layer (repositories and data sources)
- Domain layer (use cases)
- Permission management and onboarding flow
- App-open detection engine
- Lock overlay with authentication
- Focus mode implementation
- Background services and WorkManager
- Compose UI screens

## Permissions Explained

### Usage Access
Required to monitor which apps are opened and trigger blocking when necessary. This is the primary detection mechanism.

### Display Over Other Apps
Allows the app to show lock screens over blocked apps. Essential for the blocking functionality.

### Accessibility Service
Backup detection method for devices where Usage Access might not work reliably (some OEM customizations).

### Battery Optimization Exemption
Prevents the system from killing the app's background services, ensuring reliable blocking.

### VPN Service (Optional)
Only used if internet blocking is enabled during focus sessions. Allows per-app internet restrictions.
